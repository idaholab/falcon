# Mandel's problem of consolodation of a drained medium
# Using the FullySaturatedDarcyBase and FullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative kernels
#
# A sample is in plane strain.
# -a <= x <= a
# -b <= y <= b
# It is squashed with constant force by impermeable, frictionless plattens on its top and bottom surfaces (at y=+/-b)
# Fluid is allowed to leak out from its sides (at x=+/-a)
# The porepressure within the sample is monitored.
#
# As is common in the literature, this is simulated by
# considering the quarter-sample, 0<=x<=a and 0<=y<=b, with
# impermeable, roller BCs at x=0 and y=0 and y=b.
# Porepressure is fixed at zero on x=a.
# Porepressure and displacement are initialised to zero.
# Then the top (y=b) is moved downwards with prescribed velocity,
# so that the total force that is inducing this downwards velocity
# is fixed.  The velocity is worked out by solving Mandel's problem
# analytically, and the total force is monitored in the simulation
# to check that it indeed remains constant.
#
# Here are the problem's parameters, and their values:
# Soil width.  a = 1
# Soil height.  b = 0.1
# Soil's Lame lambda.  la = 0.5
# Soil's Lame mu, which is also the Soil's shear modulus.  mu = G = 0.75
# Soil bulk modulus.  K = la + 2*mu/3 = 1
# Drained Poisson ratio.  nu = (3K - 2G)/(6K + 2G) = 0.2
# Soil bulk compliance.  1/K = 1
# Fluid bulk modulus.  Kf = 8
# Fluid bulk compliance.  1/Kf = 0.125
# Soil initial porosity.  phi0 = 0.1
# Biot coefficient.  alpha = 0.6
# Biot modulus.  M = 1/(phi0/Kf + (alpha - phi0)(1 - alpha)/K) = 4.705882
# Undrained bulk modulus. Ku = K + alpha^2*M = 2.694118
# Undrained Poisson ratio.  nuu = (3Ku - 2G)/(6Ku + 2G) = 0.372627
# Skempton coefficient.  B = alpha*M/Ku = 1.048035
# Fluid mobility (soil permeability/fluid viscosity).  k = 1.5
# Consolidation coefficient.  c = 2*k*B^2*G*(1-nu)*(1+nuu)^2/9/(1-nuu)/(nuu-nu) = 3.821656
# Normal stress on top.  F = 1
#
# The solution for porepressure and displacements is given in
# AHD Cheng and E Detournay "A direct boundary element method for plane strain poroelasticity" International Journal of Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics 12 (1988) 551-572.
# The solution involves complicated infinite series, so I shall not write it here
