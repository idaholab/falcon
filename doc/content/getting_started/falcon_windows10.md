# Windows 10

!alert! warning
Using MOOSE on Windows 10 is experimental and not fully supported.

Caveats:

- Peacock does not work correctly (artifacts during rendering: surface normals are flipped).
- Different flavors of Linux are available.

    - Be sure to choose an OS in which we support. While MOOSE will ultimately work on just about every flavor of Linux, this document assumes you have chosen Ubuntu 20.04.
